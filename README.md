# Crawlcheck

Crawlcheck is a web crawler invoking plugins on received content.
It's intended for verification of websites prior to deployment.
The process of verification is customizable by configuration script that allows
complex specification which plugins should check particular URIs and
content-types.

## Version

1.0.1

## Dependencies

Crawlcheck's engine currently runs on Python 3.5 and uses SQLite3 as a
database backend. Crawlcheck uses a number of open source projects to work
properly. Python dependencies are listed in
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/eghuro/crawlcheck/blob/master/requirements.txt)

For a web report, there's a [separate project](https://github.com/eghuro/crawlcheck-report).

## Installation

0) You will need python3, python-pip and sqlite3, virtualenv, libmagic, libtidy,
libxml2 and libxslt installed. All dev or devel versions.

1) Fetch sources

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eghuro/crawlcheck crawlcheck
```

2) Run install script

```sh
cd crawlcheck
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

A configuration file is a YAML file defined as follows:

```sh

## Running crawlcheck

Assuming you have gone through set-up and configuration, now run checker:

```sh
cd [root]/crawlcheck/src/
python checker/ [config.yml]
```

Note: ``[root]/crawlcheck`` is where repository was cloned to,
``[config.yml]`` stands for the configuration file path.

## Plugins

There are currently 5 types of plugins: crawlers, checkers, headers, filters,
and postprocessors. The crawlers are specializing in discovering new links.
The checkers check the syntax of various files. The headers check HTTP headers
and together with the filters serve to customize the crawling process itself.
The postprocessors are used to generate reports or other outputs from
the application.

Crawlcheck is currently extended with the following plugins:

* linksFinder (crawler)
* sitemapScanner (crawler)
* tidyHtmlValidator (checker)
* tinycss (checker)
* css_scraper (checker)
* seoimg (checker)
* seometa (checker)
* dupdetect (checker)
* non_semantic_html (checker)
* contentLength (header)
* expectedType (header)
* canonical (header)
* acceptedType (header)
* acceptedUri (header)
* uri_normalizer (header)
* depth (filter)
* robots (filter)
* report_exporter (postprocessor)
* yaml_exporter (postprocessor)
* sitemap_generator (postprocessor)
* TexReporter (postprocessor)

## How to write a plugin

Go to ``crawlcheck/src/checker/plugin/``, create ``my_new_plugin.py`` and
``my_new_plugin.yapsy-plugin`` files there.
Fill out the .yapsy-plugin file:

```sh
[Core]
Name = Human readable plugin name
Module = my_new_plugin

[Documentation]
Author = Your Name
Version = 0.0
Description = My New Plugin
```

For plugin itself you need to implement following:

```sh
from yapsy.IPlugin import IPlugin
from common import PluginType
from filter import FilterException  # for headers and filters
class MyPlugin(IPlugin):

    category = PluginType.CHECKER # pick appropriate type
    id = myPlugin

    def setJournal(self, journal):
        # record journal somewhere - all categories

    def setQueue(self, queue):
        # record queue somewhere - if needed

    def setConf(self, conf):
        # record configuration - only headers and filters

    def check(self, transaction):
        # implement the checking logic here for crawlers and checkers

    def filter(self, transaction):
        # implement the filtering logic here for filters and headers
        # raise FilterException to filter the transaction out

    def setDb(self, db):
        # record DB somewhere - only postprocessors

    def process(self):
        # implement the postprocessing logic here for postprocessor
```
